	\section{System Description:} %Mathys Ellis
	\vspace{0.2in}
	
	The goal of the system is to provide the client with a secure and scalable marking and mark management system. The system is comprised of four different facets listed below. It is intended to replace the current marking and mark management system employed by the client, which is currently paper and spreadsheet based.
	
	\textbf{Student mark retrieval facet:}
	\vspace{0.1in}
	The goal of this facet is to provide the "Students" with a secure and private  means to a read-only view of their marks, for the markable items of a specified course on the system. The means by which they will view the markable items will be in the form of a website interface and android application.
	
	\textbf{Marker marking tool facet:}
	\vspace{0.1in}
	The goal of this facet is to provide "Markers", assigned to a particular course, with a mobile tool to allow then to be able to add and update the mark of a specified student on the mark list for a particular markable item of the particular course. The tool will allow "Markers" access to the mark list any location where an internet connection is present. The tool will be in the forms of a website interface and android application.   	
	
	\textbf{Lecturer mark management facet:}
	\vspace{0.1in}
	The goal of this facet is to provide "Lectures", assigned to a particular course, with a means to manage the marks of each student assigned to the course. Where the term manage comprises of adding, modifying and removing markable items, mark lists and the individual marks of students. Further the facet also has the goal of providing a means to report on mark related data of a particular course.  
	
	\textbf{Audit trail facet:}
	\vspace{0.1in}
	The goal of this facet is to give the system the ability to track all critical actions that occur on the system independent of any user interference and provide a read-only view of such trails authorised users. Where critical actions comprise of adding, updating and removing any data on the database.

		\vspace{0.15in}
		
		\textbf{Lecturer API}
		\textbf{(Priority: High, Requirement: FRQ2)}
		\begin{itemize}
			\item A task must be creatable for the following:
					\begin{itemize}
						\item Practicals
						\item Assignments
						\item Class tests
						\item Tests
					\end{itemize}
			\item Tasks should also contain the following information:
					\begin{itemize}
						\item Starting time to open access.
						\item End time if a specified time is required, else manual locking is required by lecture.
						\item A rubric must be added to show the mark allocation.
					\end{itemize}
			\item Adjust mark weight allocations.
			\item Assign security roles to teaching assistants and tutors.
			\item Move students to a different teaching assistant or tutor.
			\item Use the reporting API.
		\end{itemize}
		
		\vspace{0.15in}

		\begin{itemize}
			\item Log file for following activities:
					\begin{itemize}
					 	\item Marks added by whom and when.
					 	\item Marks changed or removed by who, when and what is the reason.
					\end{itemize}
			\item Lectures alone should be able to change marks of his own subjects.
			\item Lectures view own subjects audit logs.
			\item Head of Department alone should assign a user that can view the entire change log.
			\item No edits to the audit log allowed.
		\end{itemize}
		
		\vspace{0.15in}
		
		\textbf{Marking API}
		\textbf{(Priority: High, Requirement: FRQ4)}
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Accessible through mobile application for tutor.
			\item Display all available assessment option for teaching assistants or tutor to mark.
			\item Within assessment display all students registered for current session with a search option.
			\item Search should be available by student number, surname or name. Displaying results containing all three results.
			\item In the selected student the marking rubric should be displayed with type able fields.
			\item Marks should be submitted to the database directly after mark has been finalized for a student.
		\end{itemize}
		
		\vspace{0.15in}
		
		\textbf{Reports API}
		\textbf{(Priority: Medium-High, Requirement: FRQ5)}
		\begin{itemize}
