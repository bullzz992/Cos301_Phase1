		\subsection{Purpose:} %Verushka Moodley
		\vspace{0.1in}
		The purpose of this document is to communicate the requirements and proposed solution to the client, Mr Jan Kroeze, who requires a computer system for marking purposes. This document will outline the scope of the project and thus serve as a formal agreement and contract between the developers and the client. It will also serve as a reference and eliminate any confusion that may occur in the later stages of development.

		\subsection{Project Scope:} %Verushka Moodley
		\vspace{0.1in}
		The required computer system should aid the teaching assistants and lecturers in the University of Pretoria to mark assessments of students and the maintenance of marks thereafter. It should also allow students to keep up to date with their marks.
		The solution will consist of an application that students, teaching assistants and lecturers will use in the following way:
		•	Teaching assistants will receive mark sheets of registered students and will be allowed to assign practical marks to the students via the app. Lecturers will also be granted these permissions.
		•	Students will be able to view a list of their marks via the application
		The solution will also consist of a web interface that will allow the following:
		•	Lecturers can maintain and integrate marks
		•	Lecturers can request reports with a certain criteria. A graph of some nature or statistics will then be presented 
		•	An audit log will be updated automatically 
		The solution has the following restrictions:
		•	Users must be registered- a username and password is required for access to the system
		•	Marking sheets may only be locked/unlocked by lecturers that are assigned to the module. Teaching assistants will be allowed to update marks according to the status of the mark sheet. Students may only view their mark when the mark sheet is locked.
		•	No one may be allowed to edit the audit log. Only lecturers have permission to view the audit log.

	\section{System Description:} %Mathys Ellis
	\vspace{0.2in}
	
	The goal of the system is to provide the client with a secure, scalable and remotely accessable marking and mark management system. The system is comprised of four different facets which are listed below. It is intended to replace the current marking and mark management system employed by the client, which is currently paper and spreadsheet based.
	
	\textbf{Student mark retrieval facet:}
	\vspace{0.1in}
	The goal of this facet is to provide the "Students" with a secure and private  means to a read-only view of their marks, for the markable items of a specified course on the system. The means by which they will view the markable items will be in the form of a website interface and android application.
	
	\textbf{Marker marking tool facet:}
	\vspace{0.1in}
	The goal of this facet is to provide "Markers", assigned to a particular course, with a mobile tool to allow then to be able to add and update the mark of a specified student on the mark list for a particular markable item of the particular course. The tool will allow "Markers" access to the mark list from any location where an internet connection is present. The tool will be in the forms of a website interface and android application.   	
	
	\textbf{Lecturer mark management facet:}
	\vspace{0.1in}
	The goal of this facet is to provide "Lectures", assigned to a particular course, with a means to manage the marks of each student assigned to the course. Where the term manage comprises of adding, modifying and removing markable items, mark lists and the individual marks of students. Further the facet also has the goal of providing a means to report on mark related data on different levels of granularity of a particular course.  
	
	\textbf{Audit trail facet:}
	\vspace{0.1in}
	The goal of this facet is to give the system the ability to track all critical actions that occur on the system independent of any user interference and also provide a read-only view of such trails for authorised users of the system. Where critical actions comprise of adding, updating and removing any data on the database aswell as login and logout actions.
